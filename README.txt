InVesalius is a free 3D Medical Reconstruction Software that encourages 3D
visualization and rapid prototyping  based on 2D CT DICOM files.

All documentation is in the "docs" directory and online at
--- TODO: HTTP ---. If you're just getting started, here's
how we recommend you read the docs:

    * First, read docs/intro/install.txt for instructions on installing InVesalius.

    * Next, work through the tutorials in order (docs/intro/tutorial01.txt,
      docs/intro/tutorial02.txt, etc.).

    * You'll probably want to read through the topical guides (in docs/topics)
      next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in docs/howto) for specific
      problems, and check out the reference (docs/ref) for gory details.

Docs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think they
should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a ticket
here:
