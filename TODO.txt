TODO LIST
=============

# Contact ITK mail list to see why warning is happening when we import Analyze
files (noticed both under Windows and MacOS). Appears to be something related to
wrapper.

# Presets do Analyze
Pensar sobre como estruturá-los

# List Ctrl - Notebook data
organizar decentemente classe pai
? colocar em coluna separada a cor?
verificar questão de ordenação - no windows e no linux nao funciona, no mac sim

# Import - 0013
1st file is corrupted
---> InVesalius 3 quits
todo: simply ignore corrupted file and check other!

# Import
dcm_reader.py
-> change current structure to class
-> force return "axial" imagedata always

# GUI - insert acquistion modality
where?

# GUI / mask
When editing a mask name in notebook -> change combobox and change info inside mask
Update combo-box related to threshold mode (Bone / etc) to go to custom when user sets another mask or changes the threshold range

# Progress bar
implement both cursor and progress bar

# Gradient
never, ever, can min > max or max < min

# After editting mask name in notebook, change Mask instance ando combobox

# Change icon used in inner fold panel (invert upword arrow / dowward arrow)

# Change combo_thresh value according to mask selected / define a good treatment
# for "Custom"

# Develop import interface - a good start could be a sort of wizard, similar
# to wifi on macos

# Change references of AXIAL, SAGITAL, etc.. for constants

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.0
=============
 - Totally new GUI
 - New 3D measures feature
 - New slice editor feature
 - New threshold control feature
 - Threshold presets
 - New import DICOM process (slice reader, slice grouper)
 - Reads JPEG lossless DICOM data
 - New volume surface (polydata) creation pipeline - optimal quality
 - Does not use Slicer 3D lib anymore
 - Uses GDCM library for reading DICOM

Operations in volume:
linear measure
angular measure
annotation
cut
3d presets
MIP ou volume rendering

Operations in 2D     
linear measure
angular measure
area measure
